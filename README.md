# Differential Power Analysis Attack

This program is designed to perform a power analysis attack on the final round of an AES-128 encryption.

Input to the program is a collection of plaintext and ciphertexts as well as a power trace.

For the purposes of this exercise we will only be looking at a single time point within the sampled power trace.
